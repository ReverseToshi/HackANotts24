About the Project: Ludmila in Soviet Moscow 

## Inspiration:
We were inspired to create this fictional character and scenario by the fascinating history of Soviet Russia during the Cold War era. We wanted to explore what life would be like for a ordinary citizen, particularly a working woman like Ludmila, who is juggling her daily routine with societal expectations. As an accountant, Ludmila's financial literacy plays a crucial role in navigating the complexities of living under communism. However, this project also serves as a reminder that understanding credit and personal finance is essential for achieving long-term financial stability and peace of mind – regardless of the economic system you live in!

## This Project aims to:
Highlight the importance of financial literacy : By showcasing Ludmila's daily struggles with managing expenses, saving, and investing, we want to emphasize that being informed about personal finance is critical for making smart decisions and achieving long-term goals. Demonstrate the risks of unhealthy credit habits : Through Ludmila's experiences, we hope to illustrate the consequences of overspending, neglecting debt repayment, and accumulating excessive credit. This serves as a warning sign that can help readers avoid similar pitfalls in their own financial lives. Promote healthy relationships with credit : By exploring the benefits of responsible credit use, such as building credit scores and accessing necessary funds for important purchases or investments, we aim to inspire readers to adopt positive attitudes toward credit and personal finance.

## How we built this:

### To build this project, we drew inspiration from various sources, including: 
Historical records about Soviet Russia during the 1970s 
Everyday goods available during that time period (e.g., prices, products) 
Traditional Russian cuisine and baked goods (as a nod to Ludmila's baking hobby!) 
Common occupations for women in the USSR

We wove these elements together to create a fictional narrative for Ludmila, while emphasizing the relevance of financial literacy and healthy credit habits. 


## Challenges we ran into 

One of the significant challenges was ensuring that the credit concepts portrayed in the project accurately reflected how credit works today, particularly regarding credit scores and the implications of debt management. This required careful research and creative adjustments to ensure that Ludmila's experiences were relatable to contemporary audiences while still rooted in the historical realities of Soviet society


## Accomplishments that we're proud of 
We are proud of how this project turned out, given the challenges involved! The most significant accomplishment is creating a relatable character like Ludmila, who embodies the daily struggles and aspirations of women living in Soviet Moscow. By doing so, we hope to have created a compelling narrative that not only educates but also inspires readers to prioritise financial literacy and healthy credit habits. 



## What we learned Through this project
We learnt importance of understanding personal finance. We realised that being informed about credit, saving, and investing can make all the difference in achieving long-term financial stability and peace of mind – regardless of the economic system you live in! What's next for cREDit 


For future projects, We are excited to explore more nuanced and complex themes related to personal finance and credit. Perhaps we will delve into the world of cryptocurrency or investigate specific events and movements that shaped global finance. Let us know if you'd like us to continue!
